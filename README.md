# Haskell FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz, the classic programming interview question, implemented in Haskell.

* The first step of doing this is to pick a programming language. There are plenty of good ones out there like *php, bulbasaur, duck script, brainfuck* but the most important thing to do in an interview is to just show off how smart you are. 
* * There's no other language that's better to do this than Haskell.

# Prologue
Before any Haskell code is written, I would like to recite the [official](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZWsyUKwTbg) Haskell prayer:
```
Our Haskell, who art in binary,
hallowed be thy type system,
thy monoids come,
thy will be done,
on VSCode as it is in Emacs.
Give us this day our daily recursion,
and forgive us our side effects and infinite loops,
and lead us not into imperative languages,
but deliver us from mutation,
for thine is the type-system and the monoids,
and the pure functions, forever.

In the name of filter, map and reduce,
Amen.
```
```
May the Haskell Gods be with us as we tackle the age-old problem of FizzBuzz.
```
# Chapter 1: The Problem
FizzBuzz is a classic programming interview question. The problem is as follows:
> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

# Chapter 2: The Solution
The solution to this problem is very simple. We just need to write a function that takes in a number and returns a string. The string should be the number if it's not a multiple of 3 or 5, "Fizz" if it's a multiple of 3, "Buzz" if it's a multiple of 5, and "FizzBuzz" if it's a multiple of both 3 and 5.

# Chapter 3: The Code
The code is in `FizzBuzz.hs`

# Epilogue
No.
